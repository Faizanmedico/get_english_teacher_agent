🎓 Welcome to the English Teacher Agent!

Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the session.

🗣️ What would you like to learn or correct in English? I would like to correct English!

👩‍🏫 Teacher's Response:
Great! Please provide the English text you want to correct.

🗣️ What would you like to learn or correct in English? He go to the store.

👩‍🏫 Teacher's Response:
Grammar corrected: 'He are happy to the store.'  (Note: My simple `correct_grammar` tool only replaces 'is happy' with 'are happy'. A real LLM would fix "He go" to "He goes"!)

🗣️ What would you like to learn or correct in English? Explain present perfect.

👩‍🏫 Teacher's Response:
Explanation of present perfect: The present perfect tense connects the past with the present. It's used for actions that started in the past and continue to the present, or for actions completed in the past but relevant now. Example: 'I have lived here for five years.'

🗣️ What would you like to learn or correct in English? exit
👋 Goodbye!
